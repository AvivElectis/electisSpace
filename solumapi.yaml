    # Authentication
    AIMS SaaS uses OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol. <br>
    This authentication method requires for users to pass a <b>Bearer Token</b> with all API requests. <br>
    See <b>TOKEN SECTION</b> for details on generating and refreshing Access Tokens.

        Access tokens provide the ability to interact with SOLUM's APIs. <br>
        Access tokens are active for 24 hours and should be used for the entirety of its life before refreshing the token or creating a new access token. <br><br>
        The token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. <br>
        Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage. The only parties that should ever see the access token are the application itself, the authorization server, and resource server. The application should ensure the storage of the access token is not accessible to other applications on the same device. The access token can only be used over an HTTPS connection, since passing it over a non-encrypted channel would make it trivial for third parties to intercept.
  - name: Article Load
    description: >
        Article refers to an item that will be used to assign to a label. <br>
        An Article can be a product for retailers, it can be a bin in a warehouse, or a location for manufacturing facilities. <br>
        When a label is assigned to an Article, the label will automatically update when new Article content is added. <br>
        This section of APIs will explain about how to add and update Articles. <br><br>

        <b>MASTER Feature:</b><br>
        This feature replicates articles to stores, removing the need to add articles to every individual store. <br>
        To use this feature, set Store Code to MASTER.  <br>
        To apply to stores within a specific Area, the Area Level must be specified in masterType and Area value provided. <br>
  - name: Article Info
    description: articles info description
  - name: EAN Mapping
    description: >
        EAN Mapping is a feature to map different IDs to an Article ID.  <br>
        It is recommended to include EAN mapping as part of the optional field as part of the update Articles APIs. <br><br>

        With this mapping, the AIMS Manager will allow users to assign labels with the EAN or Article ID.  <br>
        For users building their custom assignment applications, must use the GET EAN Mapping API to retrieve the mapped Article ID and assign with the Article ID.

  - name: Gateway Registration
    description: SOLUM Gateways (aka GW) are vital for the communication between the AIMS Server and the Labels.  <br>GWs requires access to SOLUM SaaS services to retrieve information from the server.  For firewall whitelisting URLs, contact SOLUM.  <br> Once the GW retrieves the information from the Server, it then will update the labels with any new content or to run functions.

    description: Newtons Labels with LEDs have 7 color option available for use.  LEDs are used for fast finding for both consumers and employees.  
  - name: Schedule
    description: Newton Labels have multiple pages to allow future scheduling for page flips.  Multiple schedules (up to 20) can be sent to the label.  Schedules are applied for store local time.  Schedules sent to labels are stored in memory and will apply even if disconnected with a GW for up to 6 days.  New schedules sent to labels will overwrite the existing schedules.  To insert a schedule to an existing array, all schedules must be resent along with the new schedule.  Schedules should be sent at least 30minutes in advance to start time.  
  - name: NFC
    description: Near Field Communication (NFC) is the wireless communication used between the label and user device. The NFC is passive (read-only) and not active (cannot write to NFC).  With NFC information sent to the label, users can use their NFC enabled device to read the information. The most common use cases is to store a web link to the nfc, for the user to scan their device and be auto directed to a webpage.  <br><br>NFC antenna location is different for all labels.  For location details, see Newton label datasheet.  NFC readability also depends on the location of the NFC antenna on the user's device.  See user device manual for antenna location information.    
  - name: Pages
    description: Flip between multiple pages within the label.  Each individual pages must be loaded with content to be able to flip between them.  Contact SOLUM to increase your page use count.
